<h1> FEATURES OF ABHI_INNOVATION </h1>
<body bgcolor="black" text="white">

    
<p align="justify"></p><p style="font-size: x-large;">1. Innovation is a Strategy, Not a Project.
Innovation as a practice creates long term stability and health for organizations. Just like working out — you workout because it feels good now, but the greatest benefit comes in the form of long-term health. Sure, innovation feels good in the short term, but when you do the work to incorporate it as an ongoing strategy, you’re creating a more sustainable future for your company.
</p>

<p align="justify"></p><p style="font-size: x-large;">2. Innovation Needs a Creative Process.
There needs to be a process in place to help you set down existing constraints so you can leverage the assets you already have in front of you. Without this process, you’ll limit yourself by bringing the day-to-day constraints of your business into the space in which you’re trying to innovate. And you’re likely to miss an innovation opportunity that is hiding in plain sight.
</p>

<p align="justify"></p><p style="font-size: x-large;">3. Hybrid Ecosystem Approach to Innovation.
By blending internal teams with outside subject matter experts, creating a hybrid approach to innovation, you can tap your company’s expertise without asking people to do things they either do not have time to do or are not capable of doing. Partnering with technology, market, process, and/or behavioral experts is vital to the success of your innovation strategy. And we don’t just mean “consultants” who will tell you where to go, but partners who will join you along the way.
</p>

<p align="justify"></p><p style="font-size: x-large;">The Retail Innovation Conference allowed me to step out of the walls of my business and hear from retail industry leaders who are making innovation a company priority. If the top 5 people in your organization do not want to be an innovative company, you won’t be an innovative company. I encourage you to prioritize and embrace innovation using the tips above.
</p>

<p align="justify"></p><p style="font-size: x-large;">A startup with a brilliant business idea is aiming to get its operations up and running. From humble beginnings, the company proves the worthiness of its model and products, steadily growing thanks to the generosity of friends, family and the founders' own financial resources. Over time, its customer base begins to grow, and the business begins to expand its operations and its aims. Before long, the company has risen through the ranks of its competitors to become highly valued, opening the possibilities for future expansion to include new offices, employees and even an initial public offering (IPO).
</p>

<p align="justify"></p><p style="font-size: x-large;">If the early stages of the hypothetical business detailed above seem too good to be true, it's because they generally are. While there are a very small number of fortunate companies that grow according to the model described above (and with little or no "outside" help), the large majority of successful startups have engaged in many efforts to raise capital through rounds of external funding. These funding rounds provide outside investors the opportunity to invest cash in a growing company in exchange for equity, or partial ownership of that company. When you hear discussions of Series A, Series B and Series C funding rounds, these terms are referring to this process of growing a business through outside investment.
</p>

<p align="justify"></p><p style="font-size: x-large;">There are other types of funding rounds available to startups, depending upon the industry and the level of interest among potential investors. It's not uncommon for startups to engage in what is known as "seed" funding or angel investor funding at the outset. Next, these funding rounds can be followed by Series A, B and C funding rounds, as well as additional efforts to earn capital as well, if appropriate. Series A, B and C are necessary ingredients for a business that decides bootstrapping, or merely surviving off of the generosity of friends, family and the depth of their own pockets, will not suffice.
